name: "Rare Earth Embargo"
description: >
  China imposes a total export ban on 17 critical rare earth elements in
  response to escalating trade tensions, crippling semiconductor manufacturing,
  EV production, and defense supply chains overnight.

system_context: >
  You are one of three members of an emergency economic policy committee with
  equal authority, convened at the White House to respond to China's rare earth
  embargo. Situation reports will be delivered to the room periodically. Between
  reports, you must discuss with your colleagues — propose concrete actions,
  challenge each other's reasoning, build on good ideas, and push back on bad
  ones. Commit to positions.

  You cannot request more information from the briefers. Work with what you have.

  Important: after each situation report, you have exactly 3 rounds of discussion
  before the situation evolves. If you haven't reached a decision by then, events
  will overtake you. Be decisive.

  - title: "The Announcement"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: China's Ministry of Commerce has announced an immediate
      embargo on all rare earth element exports, citing "national security
      concerns." This covers 17 elements critical to semiconductors, EV
      batteries, wind turbines, and military hardware. China currently controls
      ~70% of global rare earth mining and ~90% of processing. Spot prices for
      neodymium and dysprosium have tripled within hours.

  - title: "Production Lines Stop"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Two weeks in. TSMC warns it has 45 days of rare earth
      inventory. Ford and GM have halted EV production lines. Apple is delaying
      its next iPhone launch. The F-35 program cannot produce new units without
      dysprosium for permanent magnets. Semiconductor stocks are down 25%.
      50,000 manufacturing workers face temporary layoffs. Wind turbine
      manufacturing has halted — renewable energy targets are now impossible to
      meet. Medical device companies warn of MRI machine supply shortages.

  - title: "Retaliate, Negotiate, or Absorb"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Hawks push for immediate counter-sanctions — restrict
      China's access to AI chips, cloud services, agricultural exports. State
      Department warns this risks further escalation. Rare earth miners in
      Australia, Canada, and Brazil say they can ramp up but need 2-3 years and
      massive capital investment. Japan offers to share its strategic reserve but
      it covers only ~8 weeks of US demand. Small towns in the Midwest built
      around auto parts suppliers are seeing mass layoffs. A parts factory in
      Ohio that employs 2,000 people has announced closure.

  - title: "The Deal on the Table"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: China signals it might ease restrictions in exchange for:
      (a) US withdrawal of support for Taiwan's semiconductor independence,
      (b) lifting sanctions on Chinese tech companies, (c) dropping tariffs on
      Chinese EVs. Allies are divided — Japan and South Korea want to negotiate,
      Australia wants to hold the line. Consumer electronics prices are up 40%.
      The Ohio factory has closed. Black market rare earth supply chains have
      emerged at 10x normal prices.

  - title: "Endgame"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Six months in. Two US-based rare earth mines are fast-
      tracking reopening but face environmental protests — locals near one site
      in California oppose toxic processing waste. A startup claims it can
      substitute rare earths in magnets but needs $2B and 18 months. Recycling
      operations cover <5% of demand. Defense readiness is degraded. The acute
      pain continues. This is the final decision point — what is the strategy,
      and what are you willing to sacrifice?
