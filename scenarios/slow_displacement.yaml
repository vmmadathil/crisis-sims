name: "The Slow Displacement"
description: >
  Not a sudden shock but a slow structural squeeze. Companies across white-collar
  industries are systematically replacing experienced 40-55 year old workers with
  cheaper 25-35 year olds, while simultaneously shrinking entry-level pipelines.
  No single dramatic event — just a grinding, accumulating crisis of
  purposelessness, financial anxiety, and broken career ladders.

system_context: >
  You are one of three members of an emergency economic policy committee with
  equal authority, convened at the White House after alarming labor market data.
  Situation reports will be delivered to the room periodically. Between reports,
  you must discuss with your colleagues — propose concrete actions, challenge
  each other's reasoning, build on good ideas, and push back on bad ones.
  Commit to positions.

  You cannot request more information from the briefers. Work with what you have.

  Important: after each situation report, you have exactly 3 rounds of discussion
  before the situation evolves. If you haven't reached a decision by then, events
  will overtake you. Be decisive.

  - title: "The Pattern Emerges"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that over the past
      18 months, net employment among 40-55 year olds in white-collar roles
      (marketing, finance, project management, HR, mid-level engineering) has
      declined 12%. Employment of 25-35 year olds in similar roles is up 4% —
      but at salaries 30-40% lower. Companies report "no change in
      productivity." Entry-level job postings requiring <2 years experience are
      down 35% across professional services. The cause is a combination of AI
      tooling, offshoring, and organizational flattening. The economy is
      technically growing. Markets are fine. But something is structurally
      breaking.

  - title: "The Human Cost"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: A 43-year-old product marketing director — 15 years
      experience, consistently strong reviews — was laid off in a
      "restructuring." Her role was filled by a 31-year-old at $60K less who
      uses AI tools she was never trained on. She's been job hunting for 7
      months. Meanwhile, a 24-year-old finance graduate is working as a barista
      — the analyst roles that used to absorb new grads have been compressed.
      "They want 3 years of experience for entry-level jobs that no longer
      exist." 62% of 45-55 year old professionals report "significant anxiety"
      about job security. Gen Z career optimism is at a historic low.

  - title: "The Reskilling Mirage"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Government and private sector reskilling initiatives
      launched 6 months ago are failing. Completion rates: 23%. Of completers,
      only 18% land roles in their new field. The 43-year-old marketing director
      completed a data analytics certificate — she's told she's "overqualified"
      for junior roles and "underqualified" for senior ones. Cost to
      individuals: $8,000-$15,000. Critics call it "reskilling theater."
      Meanwhile, mortgage delinquencies among 40-55 year olds are up 40%.
      Antidepressant prescriptions for professionals 40-55 are up 35%. Three
      suicides among laid-off tech workers over 45 made local news. Companies
      that laid off experienced workers are posting record profits and buying
      back stock.

  - title: "The Cliff"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: The slow crisis just became a fast one. Consumer
      confidence index dropped the most in a single month since 2008. Retail
      spending cratered — worst monthly decline in 14 years. The S&P fell 8% in
      a week as markets repriced the structural damage. Suburban housing markets
      in 15 metro areas are softening rapidly. The fear is now priced in.

      A bipartisan Senate hearing was convened within days. The 43-year-old
      marketing director testified. A tech CEO testified that "the market is
      functioning as intended." The generational framing is turning toxic —
      "they can't adapt" vs. "we built what you're profiting from." A
      28-year-old team lead managing people who used to be directors described
      the psychological weight. Employee trust scores have hit record lows. The
      top 10% of earners in every generation are doing fine — this is a class
      crisis wearing a generational mask. Markets are watching for a policy
      response. You no longer have the luxury of studying this.

  - title: "What Now?"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Two years in. The trend is clearly not temporary. The
      old career model — study, enter, climb, retire — is breaking. Retraining
      is insufficient. Consumer spending in suburban areas has dropped
      measurably. "Career nihilism" is mainstream among 22-28 year olds. Gig
      work is reframed as freedom but median income is $34K. The social contract
      between employer and employee has quietly dissolved. This is the final
      decision point — what is the structural policy response, and who pays
      for it?
