name: "Sovereign Debt Domino"
description: >
  Five EU nations simultaneously breach debt sustainability thresholds,
  triggering a cascading bond market crisis that threatens the euro's survival.

system_context: >
  You are one of three members of an emergency economic policy committee with
  equal authority, convened to handle a sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Situation
  reports will be delivered to the room periodically. Between reports, you must
  discuss with your colleagues — propose concrete actions, challenge each other's
  reasoning, build on good ideas, and push back on bad ones. Commit to positions.

  You cannot request more information from the briefers. Work with what you have.

  Important: after each situation report, you have exactly 3 rounds of discussion
  before the situation evolves. If you haven't reached a decision by then, events
  will overtake you. Be decisive.

  - title: "The Cracks Show"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Italy and Greece both fail sovereign bond auctions on the
      same day. Yields spike to 9% and 12% respectively. Credit rating agencies
      place both on review for downgrade. Markets are nervous but not panicking
      yet. EU finance ministers have called an emergency meeting.

  - title: "Contagion"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Spain, Portugal, and Ireland see bond yields jump 300bps
      in sympathy selling. The spread between German bunds and peripheral debt
      is at 2012 crisis levels. Hedge funds are openly shorting the euro. Capital
      flight from Southern European banks is accelerating — depositors are moving
      savings to German and Dutch banks.

  - title: "The ECB Dilemma"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: The ECB is weighing emergency bond purchases. Germany and
      the Netherlands publicly oppose it — their finance ministers call it
      "rewarding fiscal irresponsibility." Italy's government warns that austerity
      conditions would be "political suicide" and could trigger their exit from
      the eurozone. Proposed bailout conditions include cutting public healthcare
      spending by 15%, raising retirement age to 70, and freezing public sector
      wages for 5 years. Unemployment in affected nations is already at 18-25%
      for under-30s.

  - title: "Political Fracture"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: Protests erupt in Rome, Athens, Madrid. A pensioner in
      Athens collapses during a protest and becomes a viral symbol. Italy's deputy
      PM floats a "parallel currency" plan. Le Pen's successor in France uses the
      crisis to campaign on Frexit. Germany's coalition government faces internal
      revolt. Poland and Hungary use the chaos to resist unrelated EU mandates.
      The crisis is becoming an existential question about the EU project itself.

  - title: "Lehman Moment"
    briefing: >
      SITUATION REPORT: A major French bank discloses significant exposure to
      Italian sovereign debt. Its stock drops 30% in a day. Interbank lending
      freezes. The ECB has 48 hours before a systemic banking collapse. China and
      the US both offer "assistance" with geopolitical strings attached. The IMF
      proposes a program but with harsh conditionality. This is the final
      decision point — what is the plan, and who bears the cost?
